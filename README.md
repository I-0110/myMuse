# MY MUSE

## Description

Our My Muse is inspired by social people who loves to write and share their awesome ideas with the rest of the world. . We created this project because we are tired of other popular social medias that forced you to share pictures and videos, or are not focus on a specific project. We resolved the lack of focus. We learned that people spend 90% of the time scrolling on FaceBook and other social medias, and not sharing their thoughts and ideas that they are working on. .
